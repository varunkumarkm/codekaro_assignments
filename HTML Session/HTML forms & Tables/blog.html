        <h1>The Fascinating World of Animals: Why They Matter More Than We Realize</h1>
        <img src="animals.avif" width="800p" alt="This is an animals image">
        <p>Animals have always been an essential part of our planet’s ecosystem. From the smallest insects to the
            largest
            mammals, each species plays a unique role in maintaining the balance of nature. Yet, in our fast-changing
            world,
            many of these incredible creatures face threats due to habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and human
            activities. Understanding animals and appreciating their importance can inspire us to protect them—and
            ultimately protect the planet we share.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>One of the most extraordinary things about animals is their diversity. Scientists estimate that more than 8.7
            million species live on Earth, and many are still undiscovered. Animals are found in every environment—from
            freezing polar regions to deep oceans, dense forests, deserts, and even urban areas.</p>
